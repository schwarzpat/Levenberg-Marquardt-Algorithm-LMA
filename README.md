The Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) is a technique used to solve non-linear least squares problems, and it's particularly effective for non-linear regression. The LMA interpolates between the Gauss-Newton Algorithm (GNA) and the method of Gradient Descent. The LMA is more robust than the GNA, which means it finds a solution even if it starts very far off the final minimum. In this code:

- We define a model function, which is a sine function with parameters a, b, and c.
- We define a function to compute residuals, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values.
- We generate synthetic data by adding random noise to the values generated by the model function.
- We provide an initial guess for the parameters.
- We call the least_squares function with the 'lm' method, which stands for Levenberg-Marquardt.
- Finally, we plot the observed data and the curve fitted by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.

The plot above shows the synthetic data points generated from the sine function with added noise (shown as blue circles), and the curve fitted by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (shown as an orange line).
